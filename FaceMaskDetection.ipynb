    "\n",
    "**Let's discuss about the data (as promised)**\n",
    "\n",
    "`About the data:`\n",
    "\n",
    "* This dataset consists of `1650` images belonging to two classes: 1. `with_mask` & `without_mask`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`To create the dataset:`\n",
    "\n",
    "* Taking normal images of faces\n",
    "* Then creating a custom computer vision Python script to add face masks to them, thereby creating an artificial (but still real-world applicable) dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is actually a lot easier than it sounds once you apply facial landmarks to the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Facial landmarks allow us to automatically infer the location of facial structures, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Eyes\n",
    "* Eyebrows\n",
    "* Nose\n",
    "* Mouth\n",
    "* Jawline\n",
    "\n",
    "`Steps to apply it:`\n",
    "* To use facial landmarks to build a dataset of faces wearing face masks, we need to first start with an image of a person not wearing a face mask.\n",
    "\n",
    "* From there, we apply face detection to compute the bounding box location of the face in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Once we know where in the image the face is, we can extract the face Region of Interest (ROI).\n",
    "\n",
    "* And from there, we apply facial landmarks, allowing us to localize the eyes, nose, mouth, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Next, we need an image of a mask (with a transparent background).\n",
    "\n",
    "* This mask will be automatically applied to the face by using the facial landmarks (namely the points along the chin and nose) to compute where the mask will be placed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The mask is then resized and rotated, placing it on the face\n",
    "\n",
    "* We can then repeat this process for all of our input images, thereby creating our artificial face mask dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is a something you should be aware of when using this method to artificially create a dataset!\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use a set of images to create an artificial dataset of people wearing masks, you cannot ‚Äúre-use‚Äù the images without masks in your training set ‚Äî you still need to gather non-face mask images that were not used in the artificial generation process!\n",
    "\n",
    "If you include the original images used to generate face mask samples as non-face mask samples, your model will become heavily biased and fail to generalize well. Avoid that at all costs by taking the time to gather new examples of faces without masks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was all about the dataset i hope you found it useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's understant the preprocessing part...\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, we will scale the data between 0 and 1 and aggregate them into batches of size 32 and will resize the image to a target size of (224, 224) height & width.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, What is ImageDataGenerator? ü§î\n",
    "\n",
    "**ImageDataGenerator** class allows the users to perform image transformation while training the model and is helpful when there are large datasets which can't be loaded and transformed at once due to limited system resources.\n",
